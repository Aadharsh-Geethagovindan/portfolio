## Challenges & Solutions
<Callout title="Challenge">
Readium did not provide clear, end-to-end documentation for launching and wiring up the EPUB reader flow within a custom app architecture.
</Callout>

<Callout title="Solution">
Downloaded and ran Readium’s official test application, traced its navigation and module setup, and reverse-engineered the reader launch path to adapt it into a Compose-based, URI-driven flow.
</Callout> 

<Callout title="Outcome">
Successfully integrated full EPUB support with metadata and cover handling while maintaining a clean separation between the library, document navigation, and reader modes.
</Callout>

## Next Steps
- Add in-reader search across EPUB and PDF content

- Implement quick page navigation (jump to page/percentage/section)

- Enable RSVP start from a selected word or long-press context

- Expand RSVP controls (chunk size, pacing profiles, and visual focus modes)
