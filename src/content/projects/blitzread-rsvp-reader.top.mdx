## Overview
BlitzRead is an Android-based RSVP (Rapid Serial Visual Presentation) reader designed to explore high-speed, distraction-free reading for both EPUB and PDF documents.
The app focuses on a clean, minimal interface that lets users manage a small library, preview documents, and switch seamlessly between standard reading and RSVP mode.

## Key Features

- Per-document navigation screen with metadata, read access, and deletion controls
- Real-time WPM controls with play/pause and speed adjustment during RSVP
- EPUB support with full metadata and cover handling via Readium

## Technical Details

- EPUB support powered by the Readium Kotlin Toolkit (Navigator, Streamer, and Shared modules)

- PDF rendering implemented using Android PdfRenderer

- MVVM-style architecture with a centralized ViewModel for RSVP state and playback control
