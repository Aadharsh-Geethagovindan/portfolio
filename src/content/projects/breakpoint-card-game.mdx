## Overview
BreakPoint is a fast-paced, turn-based 3v3 tactical card battler built in Unity. Players select a team of three characters and compete to defeat the opposing team through cooldown management, signature charge timing, and status effect interactions.

## Key Features
- Round-based system with cooldowns, signature charge, and real-time status effect resolution
- Multiplayer integration using Mirror
- Animated hit resolution and impact feedback

## Technical Details
- Built in Unity (C#)
- Custom event announcement/subscription system used to decouple gameplay systems and UI
- Data-driven character content (JSON) for scalable iteration

## Challenges & Solutions
<Callout title="Challenge">
Script-to-script references scaled poorly and quickly became unmanageable.
</Callout>

<Callout title="Solution">
Introduced a centralized event announcement/subscription layer so systems could publish and subscribe without direct dependencies.
</Callout>

<Callout title="Outcome">
Reduced coupling and made UI and gameplay updates easier to extend.
</Callout>

<Callout title="Challenge">
 Particle effects do not work cleanly with UI Canvas Overlay.
</Callout>

<Callout title="Solution">
Replaced several particle-driven ambient effects with UI-friendly animated image/VFX solutions.
</Callout>  

<Callout title="Outcome">
Preserved visual feedback while keeping the UI pipeline stable.
</Callout>

## Next Steps
- Add a short gameplay demo video and a breakdown of the multiplayer model (authority + sync strategy)
- Expand the “mechanics” writeup to include turn order, targeting, and effect timing
