# BreakPoint Website

## Overview
The BreakPoint website is an online information hub for players. It provides at-a-glance character stats and movesets, plus mechanics explanations designed to onboard new players quickly.

## Key Features
- Masonry-style character browsing experience (desktop-focused)
- Individual character pages with detailed information
- Mechanics documentation for core systems and gameplay rules

## Technical Details
- React + CSS
- Content generated from a JSON replica of the game’s character data to keep information consistent and easy to update
- Deployed on Vercel

## Challenges & Solutions
**Problem:** A masonry layout that looks “dynamic” is hard to keep consistent across many screen sizes.  
**Approach:** Used a manual layout strategy that preserves the masonry appearance while remaining predictable across breakpoints.  
**Result:** Stable layout behavior without unpredictable reflow issues.

## Next Steps
- Improve responsive masonry behavior for tablet/mobile
- Add search/filter by role, element/type, or difficulty
