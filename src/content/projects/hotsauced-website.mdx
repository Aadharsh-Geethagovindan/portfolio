# HotSauced Team Website

## Overview
HotSauced is a team hub for a recreational sports group. The architecture is complete and supports content editing by team admins; the remaining work is content finalization with the leadership group.

## Key Features
- Easy-to-navigate Code of Conduct and sport-specific sections
- Admin-editable content sections without touching code
- “Next games” chips with RSVP support
- PIN-based RSVP flow to avoid account creation while keeping basic access control

## Technical Details
- Next.js + React + Tailwind
- Supabase for content storage and user/admin access
- Deployed on Vercel

## Challenges & Solutions
**Problem:** The site needed to be maintainable by non-developers after handoff.  
**Approach:** Designed a content model in Supabase + admin editing tools so updates require no code changes.  
**Result:** Admins can update content and scheduling workflows directly through the site.

## Next Steps
- Finalize content structure with team leadership
- Add nicer “season timeline” and game history views
