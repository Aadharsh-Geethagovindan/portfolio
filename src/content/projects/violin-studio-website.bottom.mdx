## Technical Details
- Vite + React for a fast, component-driven front end
- Tailwind CSS for consistent styling and rapid iteration
- Supabase for authentication, database storage, and role-based access control
- Role-based UI flows (student vs instructor) for scheduling, availability, and content editing
- Availability model built around discrete 30-minute time slots to simplify booking logic and reduce edge cases

## Challenges & Solutions
<Callout title="Challenge">
Scheduling introduced time zone discrepancies: lesson slots appeared correct locally, but storage and retrieval in UTC caused shifts and inconsistent displays across users.
</Callout>

<Callout title="Solution">
Reworked the storage and retrieval approach to be time zone agnostic by standardizing how slots are represented and converting at the edges (UI input/output), rather than mixing local date-times with UTC at multiple points in the pipeline.
</Callout>

<Callout title="Outcome">
Lesson requests and confirmations display consistently for both students and instructors, with predictable slot behavior across devices and time zones.
</Callout>

## Next Steps
- Gather client feedback and refine the booking and admin editing UX
- Add a summer camps page, including camp information and an optional sign-up flow
